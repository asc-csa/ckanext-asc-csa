#  CSA Open Data Portal Project (CKAN)  
This project was to create a web-based data Portal to centralize data, and improve data cataloguing. A prototype of the Portal was developed and is now ready for internal deployment. Features such as dataset search, external data harvesters, and enforceable metadata field validators. The CSA Open Data Portal meets the needs of users and advances the CSA Data Strategy by providing the tools necessary for data insights.  


# Introduction  
This document highlights what has been done for the CSA CKAN Open Data Portlal, and should serve as a high level guide to anyone who works on the development of CSA CKAN in the future.  

This document is structured in 2 main sections:  
- Installation and deployment  
- Development notes  

The "Installation and deployment" section of this document is a step by step guide on how to install a source install of CKAN and extend it further with CSA developed features.  

The "Development notes" section of this document goes into specifics about each developed feature of CKAN. It was originally meant as a "write as you go" document so at times it may seem a bit unclear. Development notes also includes a section at the bottom if you are using the current VM image of the CKAN install.  

There is a short guide that might be of importance called "Directory Structures" near the bottom of the document which may be useful if you want to get up and running fast.  

"Useful commands" may help you on a bunch of common tasks which could be run from terminal.  

Other helpful documents you can check out on [livelink](http://livelink/livelink/llisapi.dll?func=ll&objId=36988513&objAction=browse&viewType=1):

#  Installation and deployment  
This is the section on how to install and deploy CKAN  

If you are using the VM image to continue development you can skip this step and instead read the "Development notes" instead.  

The VM got a bit messed up after a power outage and now does not have a menu bar so everything will need to be launched from terminal.  

To launch CKAN on the VM image, right click on desktop, open a terminal window, from the home directory: `cd code/bash_scripts && bash start_ckan.sh`   
## What is CKAN  
CKAN, is the world's leading Open Source data portal platform. Information about CKAN can be found on their website:  
[ckan](https://ckan.org)  

Documentation for CKAN can be difficult to get into, but overall is very well done. There is also a really helpful [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/ckan/chat) for CKAN developers. Below you can find documentation on the installation process to get the source version of CKAN along with the extensions that support CSA features. The installation process should take 4-6 hours, and must be done on a UNIX machine, preferably using a Ubuntu 16.04.  

## Installing CKAN from source  

Copied with some modifications from: [https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/installing/deployment.html](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/installing/deployment.html)  

###  1. Install the required packages  
If you’re using a Debian-based operating system (such as Ubuntu) install the required packages with this command for Ubuntu 16.04:  

 sudo apt-get install python-dev postgresql libpq-dev python-pip python-virtualenv git-core solr-jetty openjdk-8-jdk redis-server  
or for Ubuntu 14.04:  

 sudo apt-get install python-dev postgresql libpq-dev python-pip python-virtualenv git-core solr-jetty openjdk-6-jdk redis-server  ###  2. Install CKAN into a Python virtual environment  
Run these commands to create a symlink between the directories used in this install and to your home directory.  

```  
mkdir -p ~/ckan/lib  
sudo ln -s ~/ckan/lib /usr/lib/ckan  
mkdir -p ~/ckan/etc  
sudo ln -s ~/ckan/etc /etc/ckan  
```  

Create a Python [virtual environment](http://www.virtualenv.org/) (virtualenv) to install CKAN into, and activate it:  
```  
sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/ckan/default  
sudo chown `whoami` /usr/lib/ckan/default  
virtualenv --no-site-packages /usr/lib/ckan/default  
. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate  
```  
*Note: whoami is wrapped in a grave accent not a normal single quotation*  

**Important**  
The final command above activates your virtualenv. The virtualenv has to remain active for the rest of the installation and deployment process, or commands will fail. You can tell when the virtualenv is active because its name appears in front of your shell prompt, something like this:  

 (default) $ _  
For example, if you logout and login again, or if you close your terminal window and open it again, your virtualenv will no longer be activated. You can always reactivate the virtualenv with this command:  

 . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate  
Install the recommended `setuptools` version:  
```  
 pip install setuptools==36.1  
```  
Install the CKAN source code into your virtualenv.  
 ```  
 pip install -e 'git+https://github.com/ckan/ckan.git@ckan-2.8.5#egg=ckan'
```  
Install the Python modules that CKAN requires into your virtualenv:  
 ```  
 pip install -r /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/requirements.txt  
```  
Deactivate and reactivate your virtualenv, to make sure you’re using the virtualenv’s copies of commands like `paster` rather than any system-wide installed copies:  

```  
deactivate  
. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate  
```  
###  3. Setup a PostgreSQL database  

Check that PostgreSQL was installed correctly by listing the existing databases:  
```    
 sudo -u postgres psql -l  
```  
Check that the encoding of the databases are `UTF8`, if not internationalisation may be a problem. Since changing the encoding of PostgreSQL may mean deleting existing databases, it is suggested that this is fixed before continuing with the CKAN install.  

Next you’ll need to create a database user if one doesn’t already exist. Create a new PostgreSQL database user called ckan_default, and enter a password for the user when prompted. [make the password: "Alouette1CSA"] You’ll need this password later:  
 ```  
 sudo -u postgres createuser -S -D -R -P ckan_default  
```  
Create a new PostgreSQL database, called ckan_default, owned by the database user you just created:  
 ```  
 sudo -u postgres createdb -O ckan_default ckan_default -E utf-8  
```  
###  4. Create a CKAN config file  
Create a directory to contain the site’s config files:  
```  
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ckan/default  
sudo chown -R `whoami` /etc/ckan/  
sudo chown -R `whoami` ~/ckan/etc  
```  

Create the CKAN config file:  
*You may need to install paster using this command below before executing the following command:*  
 ```  
 pip install paster  
```  
If paster is already installed:  
 ```  
 paster make-config ckan /etc/ckan/default/development.ini  
```  
Edit the `development.ini` file in a text editor, changing the following options:  

**sqlalchemy.url**  
This should refer to the database we created in above: 3. Setup a PostgreSQL database.  

 sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://ckan_default:Alouette1CSA@localhost/ckan_default  
**site_id**  

 ckan.site_id = default  
**site_url**  
Provide the site’s URL (used when putting links to the site into the FileStore, notification emails etc). If you are unsure of the url this should be the default:  

 ckan.site_url = http://127.0.0.1:5000  
Do not add a trailing slash to the URL.  

###  5. Setup Solr  
CKAN uses [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) as its search platform, and uses a customized Solr schema file that takes into account CKAN’s specific search needs. Now that we have CKAN installed, we need to install and configure Solr.  

Make sure you have permissions for the following file with this command:  

 sudo chown -R \`whoami\` /etc/default/jetty8  
Edit the Jetty configuration file (`/etc/default/jetty8` or `/etc/default/jetty`) and change the following variables:  

```  
NO_START=0            # (line 4)  
JETTY_HOST=127.0.0.1  # (line 16)  
JETTY_PORT=8983       # (line 19)  
```  
* Note: You must uncomment lines 16 and 19

Start or restart the Jetty server.  

For Ubuntu 16.04:  

 sudo service jetty8 restart  
Or for Ubuntu 14.04:  

 sudo service jetty restart  
You should now see a welcome page from Solr if you open [http://localhost:8983/solr/](http://localhost:8983/solr/) in your web browser (replace localhost with your server address if needed).  

Note:  
If you get the message  `Could  not  start  Jetty  servlet  engine  because  no  Java  Development  Kit  (JDK)  was  found.` then you will have to edit the  `JAVA_HOME` setting in  `/etc/default/jetty` to point to your machine’s JDK install location. For example:  

 JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/  
or:  

 JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-i386/  
Replace the default `schema.xml` file with a symlink to the CKAN schema file included in the sources.  

```  
sudo mv /etc/solr/conf/schema.xml /etc/solr/conf/schema.xml.bak  
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/ckan/config/solr/schema.xml /etc/solr/conf/schema.xml  
```  
Now restart Solr:  
For Ubuntu 16.04:  

 sudo service jetty8 restart  
or for Ubuntu 14.04:  

 sudo service jetty restartCheck that Solr is running by opening [http://localhost:8983/solr/](http://localhost:8983/solr/).  

Finally, change the solr_url setting in your CKAN configuration file (/etc/ckan/default/development.ini) to point to your Solr server, for example:  

 solr_url=http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr  
### 6. Link to  `who.ini`  
`who.ini` (the Repoze.who configuration file) needs to be accessible in the same directory as your CKAN config file, so create a symlink to it:  
 ```  
 ln -s /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/who.ini /etc/ckan/default/who.ini  
```  
###  7. Create database tables  
Now that you have a configuration file that has the correct settings for your database, you can create the database tables.  

```  
cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan  
paster db init -c /etc/ckan/default/development.ini  
```  

You should see `Initialising  DB:  SUCCESS`.  

###  8. Set up the DataStore  
Clarify what datastore  

#### a. Enable the plugin  
  Add the `datastore` plugin to your CKAN config file (/etc/ckan/default/development.ini) :  


 ckan.plugins = datastore  
#### b. Set-up the database  
The DataStore requires a separate PostgreSQL database to save the DataStore resources to.  

List existing databases:  
 ```  
 sudo -u postgres psql -l
 ```  
Check that the encoding of databases is `UTF8`, if not internationalisation may be a problem. Since changing the encoding of PostgreSQL may mean deleting existing databases, it is suggested that this is fixed before continuing with the datastore setup.  

#### c. Create users and databases  

Create a database_user called datastore_default. This user will be given read-only access to your DataStore database in the Set Permissions step below:  
  ```  
 sudo -u postgres createuser -S -D -R -P -l datastore_default  
 ```  
Create the database (owned by ckan_default), which we’ll call datastore_default [set password to Canada1Alouette]":  

 sudo -u postgres createdb -O ckan_default datastore_default -E utf-8  ####  d. Set URLs  

Now, uncomment the ckan.datastore.write_url and ckan.datastore.read_url lines in your CKAN config file and edit them if necessary, for example:  

 ckan.datastore.write_url = postgresql://ckan_default:[pass@localhost/]datastore_default ckan.datastore.read_url = postgresql://datastore_default:[pass@localhost/]datastore_default  
Replace `pass` with the passwords you created for your ckan_default [should be "Alouette1CSA"] and datastore_default [should be "Canada1Alouette"] database users.  

#### e. Set permissions  

Once the DataStore database and the users are created, the permissions on the DataStore and CKAN database have to be set. CKAN provides a paster command to help you correctly set these permissions.  

 paster  --plugin=ckan  datastore  set-permissions  -c  /etc/ckan/default/development.ini  |  sudo  -u  postgres  psql  --set  ON_ERROR_STOP=1  
### 9. Test the setup so far  
You can now use the Paste development server to serve CKAN from the command-line. This is a simple and lightweight way to serve CKAN that is useful for development and testing:  

```  
cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan  
paster serve /etc/ckan/default/development.ini  
```  

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in a web browser, and you should see the CKAN front page.  


##  Extending CKAN with CSA Features  
The sections "Installing CKAN from source" and "Deploying a source install" above set up a vanilla version of CKAN. To extend CKAN to contain developed features for the CSA follow the steps below.  

###  1. Installing Extensions  
To install Scheming, Fluent, and CSA extensions you will need git to clone the necessary files into the CKAN extensions directory. Git should have been installed in the above steps. If the CKAN server is running, turn the server off with `CTRL C`.  

Before starting make sure that the python virtual environment is running.  

 . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate  
Now navigate to CKAN's extension directory  

```  
cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src  
```  

Clone the scheming repository into the directory  
  ```  
 git clone !!!To be updated!!!!  
 ```  
Clone the fluent extension into the directory  
  ```  
 git clone https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-fluent.git
 ```  
Clone the CSA extension into the directory  

 ```   
git clone  git clone !!!To be updated!!!!  
```  

In CKAN's configuration file (/etc/ckan/default/development.ini) edit to include these settings. Some of these settings will be existing others will not be and must be added. Make sure that the settings are above the logging configuration settings or they will not be parsed.  

```  
ckan.plugins = stats text_view image_view recline_view csa scheming_datasets fluent datastore  

## Scheming Settings  

scheming.dataset_schemas = ckanext.csa:ckan_dataset.json  
 ckanext.csa:info.json ckanext.csa:doc.json  
scheming.presets = ckanext.csa:presets.json  
 ckanext.fluent:presets.json  
licenses_group_url = http://{ip of CKAN instance}/licenses.json  

# Example: licenses_group_url = http://127.0.0.1:5000/licenses.json  

ckan.locale_default = en  
ckan.locale_order = en fr  
ckan.locales_offered = en fr  
```  

Before continuing you should build each extension. You should be in the ckan src directory, if not execute:  

 cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src  
Enter into each extension directory and build the extension  

 cd ckanext-scheming 
 pip install -r requirements.txt 
 python setup.py develop 
 
 cd ..     
 cd ckanext-fluent  
 python setup.py develop 
 
 cd ..     
 cd ckanext-csa  
 python setup.py develop 
 cd ..  
 
###  2. Modify `schema.xml` file for custom CKAN search  
Copy the contents of the `schema.xml` file from the CSA extension into the original `schema.xml` file.  

```  
cp /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckanext-csa/ckanext/csa/conf/solr/schema.xml /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/ckan/config/solr/schema.xml  
```  
You can also do this manually by copy and pasting the contents of the `schema.xml` file from ckanext-csa into the specified file location above.  

Restart jetty after editing the `schema.xml` file  

For Ubuntu 16.04:  

 sudo service jetty8 restart  
Or for Ubuntu 14.04:  

 sudo service jetty restart###  3. Test the extensions  
Restart the CKAN server and access the site from a browser. CSA features should now be present on the page.  

```  
. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate  
cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan  
paster serve /etc/ckan/default/development.ini  
```  

## Setting up your installation

You will now want to create a sysadmin user and possibly import organizations to facilitate your work. This section is optionnal but will guide you through that process.


paster sysadmin add seanh email=seanh@localhost name=seanh -c /etc/ckan/default/development.ini

where seah will be replace by your username. You can find more instruction on
https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/getting-started.html#create-admin-user

Once done, you will need to manually copy the file transitional_orgs.json from the ckanext-csa extension to the directory containing the development.ini file. Once in this directory, open a command prompt and use the following commands :
```  
. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate  
ckanapi load organizations -I transitional_orgs.jsonl
```  


In the development.ini file, add

ckan.storage_path = /var/lib/ckan/default

and execute the commands
```
paster --plugin=ckan datastore set-permissions -c /etc/ckan/default/development.ini
```


###Set up the datapusher

The datapusher doesn't require any modification as it runs along ckan and not inside it. You can follow the regular documentation
for this steps
https://docs.ckan.org/projects/datapusher/en/latest/
##  Deploying a source install  
After installing source follow this guide to deploy it to a production server.  
[https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/installing/deployment.html](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/installing/deployment.html)  

Notes:  

Apache log files can be found in var/log/apache2.  
There has been permission denied errors on /tmp/default/sessions from the wsgi. A temporary solution is to execute the command:  

 sudo chmod -R 777 /tmp  
#  Development Notes  

## Introduction to Development Notes  

Where above was a guide to install CKAN, below are the notes I have taken to communicate the progress that has been made so far.  

## Directory Structure and Specific Files of ckanext-csa  
  All paths below are relative to the git repository `ckanext-csa`. This repository can be found at [gccode gitlab](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/csa-data-centre-of-expertise/ckanext-csa). You will need to create an account first to access the repository which can be done with your Government of Canada email.
 - /readme - contains this document in the most updated form
 - /ckanext/csa - contains most of the code that adds CSA features to CKAN
 - /ckanext/csa/templates - contains most of the code that deals with what is rendered on the front end in terms of html
 - /ckanext/csa/fanstatic - contains the css and js files that are customized and added on top of what CKAN provides by default.
 - /ckanext/csa/presets.json - contains some presets that are used as scheming fields found in ckan_datasets.json
 - /ckanext/csa/ckan_datasets.json - contains the scheming fields on the CKAN instance
 - /ckanext/csa/plugin.py - contains the plugin class that uses [CKAN's plugin interface](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/extensions/plugin-interfaces.html) to customize and [extend features](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/extensions/tutorial.html)
 - /ckanext/csa/helpers.py - contains [helper functions](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/theming/templates.html#adding-your-own-template-helper-functions) that are used in templates

 - /ckanext/csa/conf/solr/schema.xml - contains the modified schema that implements bilingual search and facetted search
 -


##  Defining a custom schema and storing and displaying bilingual metadata  
A custom schema was defined using the [scheming](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-scheming) extension. After downloading the scheming extension, configuration files where changed to reference .json files that contain definitions for fields. Documentation regarding specific options and settings for scheming fields can be found on the scheming github page.  

```  
scheming.dataset_schemas = ckanext.csa:ckan_dataset.json  
 ckanext.csa:info.json ckanext.csa:doc.json ckanext.scheming.tests:test_schema.json ckanext.scheming.tests:test_datastore_choices.json  
scheming.presets = ckanext.csa:presets.json  
 ckanext.fluent:presets.json  
```  
To render bilingual  forms and store bilingual metadata the [fluent](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-fluent) extension was used. Fluent provides extra presets that allows storage of metadata in multiple languages.  

After installing these extensions to customize the schema a ckanext-csa was created with definitions of metadata schemas in /ckanext/csa/ckan_datasets.json with references to custom presets in /ckanext/csa/presets.json.  

##  Harvesters  
Harvesting data from other sources is an important part of the CSA's implementation of CKAN. Currently CSA CKAN has scripts written to harvest data from DIIDS (Data and Information Inventory and Disclosure System) and the [Government of Canada Open Data Portal](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data).  

On a new install of CKAN these harvesters should be used to populate the datasets with datasets from DIIDS and Government of Canada Open Data.  

Harvesting scripts will need an API key found in an administrator account on the CKAN user account page. The ip of the CKAN instance should also be included in these scripts. By default the ip included in the scripts should work with the development install of CKAN.  

###  Harvesting data from Government of Canada Open Data  
Harvesting data from Government of Canada can be done from an external computer/server. It is done through HTTP API requests.  

The code is written in Python, sending and receiving API requests using urllib.  

Git clone this file and follow the readme for instructions on how to use it. You will probably have to edit some of the variables within the scripts to get things working with your instance of CKAN. You also need to have an API key from an administrator account to create the new datasets from the data extracted through the Open Government Canada API. This code is also available on livelink.  


[https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/csa-data-centre-of-expertise/ckan-gov-canada-harvester](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/csa-data-centre-of-expertise/ckan-gov-canada-harvester)  


###  Harvesting data from DIIDS  
Harvesting data from DIIDS can be done from an external computer/server. It is done through HTTP API requests. This is quite similar to the Government of Canada harvester but instead of taking the files from a GET request, it takes data from a source csv file downloaded from DIIDS. Please see the "Unicode Problems" section of this document to ensure the CSV is in the correct format. That would include save as in notepad to UTF-8. Take a look at that section below.  

Creating Datasets with DIIDS may fail with this extension in it's current state because of new validators that have been put on the forms. In specific there are some fields that are required that would not be found from DIIDS only found in Government of Canada Open Data Portal. This was not dealt with earlier because there wasn't a way to know which fields would be needed later, so it was easiest just to keep everything the same before someone with the domain knowledge would author a guide on what metadata fields to use.  

Git clone this file and follow the readme for instructions.  
[https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/csa-data-centre-of-expertise/ckan-didds-harvester](https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/csa-data-centre-of-expertise/ckan-didds-harvester)  

##  Using the Datastore  
CKAN includes an extension called "Datastore" that uses Postgres to store tabular data. You will first need to setup Filestore because Datastore is complementary to the Datastore. The documentation for this can be found below:  
[https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/datastore.html](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/datastore.html)  

To use the Datastore you might need to first install the Datapusher, which is an application that automatically takes .csv files from the Filestore and pushes that data into the Datastore. The Datastore can also be used with API.  


##  Integration with other platforms (query for data)  
Querying CKAN from other applications can be done in two different ways. The first and most simple is to do a url download request like found below:  
https://stackabuse.com/download-files-with-python/  

The other option would be to use CKAN's API for tabular data. API reference for the datastore can be found online at this link:   
https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/datastore.html#the-datastore-api  

Although there could be some limitation with the datastore API especially when trying to query for tens of thousands of rows. After discussions for stand alone applications such as individual satellite visualizations it may be best just to download/cache the file on the server/machine that is running the application.  



##  Installing Datapusher  
Datapusher automatically harvests data from csv files linked and stores them into the Datastore.  
[DataPusher](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/datapusher) is a service that runs asynchronously and can be installed alongside CKAN.  
Installation inscructions can be found below:  
[https://docs.ckan.org/projects/datapusher/en/latest/](https://docs.ckan.org/projects/datapusher/en/latest/)  

If you are using the old VM image datapusher is already set up, it can be found in `/home/csauser/datapusher`. To start the data pusher `python datapusher/main.py deployment/datapusher_settings.py`. This is currently set in development mode and should be changed to production mode if deployed. Further documentation can be found at the link above.  


## Bilingual facets  
Facets are controlled by ckanext-csa by using the IFacets interface in plugins.py. Here facets_dict is updated to include more facets. In addition to updating the interface multiple templates had to be created to account for the French and English versions of each of the facet values. The main problem here was that the facet would display the value instead of the localized label for each selection. This problem was solved by customizing templates to show the label of the correct language to the user of the website. The templates can be found in this repository (ckanext-csa).  

These templates were created to accomplish this task:  
 - ckanext/csa/templates/package/search.html
 - ckanext/csa/templates/snippets/facet_list.html  
 - ckanext/csa/templates/snippets/dataset_facets.html  
 - ckanext/csa/templates/macros/csa_read.html  

In addition to editing the templates, for subject and keywords it was a special case because these are multivalued and also contain French and English versions. To solve this problem first as part of the IPackageController interface before_index had to be configured   
```  
def before_index(self, pkg_dict):  
 kw = json.loads(pkg_dict.get('extras_keywords', '{}')) pkg_dict['keywords_en'] = kw.get('en', []) pkg_dict['keywords_fr'] = kw.get('fr', []) pkg_dict['subject'] = json.loads(pkg_dict.get('subject', '[]')) return pkg_dict
```  

After defining a before_index function to modify the dataset/package dictionary before SOLR indexing, I manually specified a multivalued field in schema.xml  
```
<field name= "keywords_en" type="string" indexed="true" stored="true" multiValued="true"/>  
<field name= "keywords_fr" type="string" indexed="true" stored="true" multiValued="true"/>  
<field name="subject" type="string" indexed="true" stored="true" multiValued="true"/>  
```  
Once modified SOLR server must be reindexed manually by using a paster command in the virtual environment where CKAN is installed.  

`paster search-index rebuild -r `

Facets for the organization page have not been fully integrated with the new facet functionality because that page should removed because the organization structure should be abstracted away from the user. If not the facets can be implemented by changing the template files to render language specific values.  


## Bilingual metadata display on search page  
This was a simple fix, and was done by creating snippets/package_item.html and creating some helper functions in helpers.py to display the correct version of the text by calling h.lang().  

## Translating internationalized strings  
To translate the UI strings first you must mark the string as being translatable within the Python or Jinja code. Then you must custom create a .po file with those manual translations. CKAN provides a [great guide](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/extensions/translating-extensions.html) to implement this. String translations English to French were taken from GC Canada, located [here](https://github.com/open-data/ckanext-canada/blob/master/ckanext/canada/i18n/fr/LC_MESSAGES/canada.po).  

##  Bilingual search engine  
After customizing fields to include French and English support, content search was not working as expected. Simple searches of whole titles were not displaying any datasets.   

I reached out to Ian Ward (CKAN Development Team Member also GC Public Servant) to ask for some advice on how to solve this problem, his reply is below.  
Notes from Ian Ward:

CKAN search uses [SOLR](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/index.html) for content discovery. The file "schema.xml" specifies the settings for the search schema. It can be found in this path "/usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/ckan/config/solr/schema.xml". A modified copy that includes the changes is included within ckanext-csa. It was first good to learn how a solr search works ([Analyzers, Tokenizers, and Filters](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/understanding-analyzers-tokenizers-and-filters.html)).   

CKAN package search logic can be found on [github](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/blob/master/ckan/logic/action/get.py#L1705).  

To remedy search I custom defined new a new field type in schema.xml which uses a special process on French text

After defining the new field I modified my before_index to extract from pkg_dict the terms I wanted to include within the search index, in this case being notes_fr, title_fr. Next I added multi-valued res_name_fr. I had to parse through the source code of CKAN to determine where the query was being executed. The code for that can be found [here](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/blob/master/ckan/lib/search/query.py#L253). To debug the code I added in some print statements that are included in this snippet of code.   
```  
 conn = make_connection(decode_dates=False) log.debug('Package query: %r' % query) print query try: solr_response = conn.search(**query) for result in solr_response: print result
```  
CKAN uses a library called [pysolr](https://github.com/django-haystack/pysolr) to interface with Solr, it was useful to take a look at some of the documentation for how CKAN does a query.  

After I was able to view the query I realized I had to change the 'qf' search parameter to specify that I wanted to weight the French fields higher when searching when CKAN is set to French. CKAN uses DisMax to do searches, documentation for that is [here](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/the-dismax-query-parser.html#TheDisMaxQueryParser-Theqf_QueryFields_Parameter) this link also helps you to understand what 'qf' does.  

**Important note:** when doing development of search you will need to restart the SOLR server and reindex the the current packages. How to do this is found in terminal commands in the the Tips and Tricks section of this document.  



---------------------------------
###Registering ckanext-csa on PyPI
---------------------------------

ckanext-csa should be availabe on PyPI as
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ckanext-csa. If that link doesn't work, then
you can register the project on PyPI for the first time by following these
steps:

1. Create a source distribution of the project::

     python setup.py sdist

2. Register the project::

     python setup.py register

3. Upload the source distribution to PyPI::

     python setup.py sdist upload

4. Tag the first release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the ``setup.py`` file. For example if the version number in ``setup.py`` is
   0.0.1 then do::

       git tag 0.0.1
       git push --tags


----------------------------------------
Releasing a New Version of ckanext-csa
----------------------------------------

ckanext-csa is availabe on PyPI as https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ckanext-csa.
To publish a new version to PyPI follow these steps:

1. Update the version number in the ``setup.py`` file.
   See `PEP 440 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#public-version-identifiers>`_
   for how to choose version numbers.

2. Create a source distribution of the new version::

     python setup.py sdist

3. Upload the source distribution to PyPI::

     python setup.py sdist upload

4. Tag the new release of the project on GitHub with the version number from
   the ``setup.py`` file. For example if the version number in ``setup.py`` is
   0.0.2 then do::

       git tag 0.0.2
       git push --tags
## Unicode Problems  
There has been some problems with French characters displaying weird on CKAN. My first guess here is that the problem is actually when I import the data into CKAN via the API requests. I do some preliminary cleaning in Pandas and I think I was careless when specifying the encoding of things and not being consistent with Unicode that it got messed up along the way.  
Turns out that some of the old code converted unicode objects into strings when doing regular expressions. It has now been fixed to preserve the unicode object type. Another problem I ran into was that the csv that is exported from DIIDS would be encoded by default with Windows Latin, when it should be standardized to utf-8. To fix this after saving the file as a csv, open with notepad, save as type All Files, Encoding utf-8. Save this as a csv.  

Since CKAN still uses python 2, only python 2 was installed on the VM. It is thus good practice to include `#-*- coding: utf-8 -*-` at the top of the page to ensure that the python script uses the utf-8 codec. If CKAN is updated to fully use Python 3 this can be ignored.   

## Custom defined licenses  
To add custom licenses you must define them within a json file and then point the configuration file to that location within an extension. There is a great [blog post](https://boykoc.github.io/ckan/configuration/2018/06/13/adding-custom-licenses-in-ckan.html) by Cody Boyko about the topic. I also implemented a helper function for templates to be able to get the license based on the license id. the license definitions currently implemented can be found in ckanext/csa/public/licenses.json.  


##  WET (Web Experience Toolkit) with CKAN  
A preliminary discovery phase was conducted to determine the feasibility of integrating WET into CKAN. The Government of Canada has integrated WET into their instance of CKAN. There was an attempt to create a CKAN extension wet-boew that would add WET to CKAN, but this project was never completed and the extension no longer works with the newer version of CKAN that is used by the CSA. Since the new version does use the new Bootstrap version, the scope of integrating WET would be less, but still large.  

The start of integration with WET has commenced. There is a lot of work to be done to complete the integration.  

Next steps for this implementation and other notes about this topic can be found on livelink ["Web Experience Toolkit and GC Web Implementation Notes.docx"](http://livelink/livelink/llisapi.dll?func=ll&objId=43843079&objAction=viewheader).

It might be of interest to attend WET-BOEW code sprints on Tuesdays from 9h30 to 15h30, you can contact pierre.dubois@servicecanada.gc.ca for more information and also information to join remotely.  


##  Customizing CKAN's default html files  
Documentation for how to customize CKAN's templates can be found on CKAN's official documentation page:  
[https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/theming/templates.html](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/theming/templates.html)  

The current vanilla templates (unmodified) can be found on the official CKAN github page:  
https://github.com/ckan/ckan/tree/master/ckan/templates  

Some templates have already been modified and are available with the ckanext-csa extension.  

##  Editing scheming templates  
I encountered a problem where I couldn't get templates to change read.html in the package directory. It turns out that the problem was that the file had to be in the ckanext/csa/templates/scheming/package directory instead of the ckanext/csa/templates/package directory.  

##  Hiding Header and implementing CKAN in an iframe  
To hide the header simply create an empty header.html file in the templates file. To implement CKAN in an iframe first create an iframe in html:  
```
<div class="iframe-container">  
 <iframe src="http://yourckan.url"></iframe></div>  
```

Then create a CSS class to make the iframe responsive:  
```  
.iframe-container {  
 overflow: hidden; padding-top: 56.25%; position: relative;}  

.iframe-container iframe {  
 border: 0; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;}  

.iframe-container-4x3 {  
 padding-top: 75%;}  
```  
As of December 2019 after a meeting with CSA Communications the iframe approach has been scrubbed instead the approach will be to have CSA CKAN be an independent application fully integrated with GCWeb branding.  

##  JS Dataset descriptors  
The work done closely followed CKAN's documentation on customizing its JavaScript, this tutorial can be found: [https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/theming/javascript.html](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/theming/javascript.html)  
CSA's features can be found in ckanext/csa/fanstatic/csa_field_descriptions.js  

A high level summary of what has been implemented is that the backend passes data parsed from JSON into a template through a template helper function and then on the front end that is displayed using an AJAX call.  
The backend functionality can be found mostly in plugins.py. A template helper function `csa_get_field_desciption` is a template helper function that is available for use in templates.  


Due to accessibility concerns the hover functionality of the dataset descriptor should be changed to a button. Definitions of the dataset field values can be modified in field_descriptions.json. Support for English and French was built.  

##  CSA CKAN Accessibility Report  

If the CSA CKAN instance would be released to the public it must meet the WCAG 2.0 Accessibility Level AA as specified by the Standard on Web Accessibility.   

A preliminary accessibility report was conducted. Details of this report can be found on livelink.  

##  Redirecting homepage to "datasets"  
This was done using the IRoutes plugin interface and defining a redirect from / to /datasets. This modification can be seen in ckanext/csa/plugin.py.

##  CKAN License  
CKAN has a very specific license called **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0**. This license specifies that "When a modified version is used to provide a service over a network, the complete source code of the modified version must be made available."

It's good to reference these other CKAN instances to identify what is possible with CKAN. All of these CKAN instances also have their code on GitHub so you can reverse engineer the features that you want to implement.


## Tips and Tricks  
This subsection has some tips and tricks for anyone who is developing in CKAN.  
#### A bash script can be defined to start ckan automatically  
```  
#!/bin/bash  

. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate  
cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan  
paster serve /etc/ckan/default/development.ini  
```  

#### Using a text editor such as VS Code search globally for variables or references to certain topics  


#### Debugging can be done using Jinja templates by "printing" variables onto the web page  

 <p>{{ foo }}</p>  

#### Features identified in other CKAN data portals can help with implementing similar features  
Download the whole ckanext-canada source code and look through how they did specific things.  
You can use an IDE's "find in all" files to help with that.  


##  Next steps  

A roadmap can be found on livelink with the filename "CSA CKAN Development Roadmap"  

Note: CSA CKAN references the current instance of CKAN at the CSA.  

Some next steps directly would be to fully implement WET and Canada.ca branding to CSA CKAN. Some rough notes about that process can be found in "Canada Branding Technical Implementation Workshop.docx". There is some good links to resources to learn how to do that. From what it looks like so far it would involve editing the current CSS and HTML elements within CKAN to follow the same format as what is found in WET.   

Cloud storage for CKAN should be investigated although it may not be possible because there may not be approval for that. In that case it would be worthwhile to look into the accessibility   

Some other key next steps  

- [ ] Fully integrate WET and Canada.ca branding to CSA CKAN  
- [ ] Investigate how CSA CKAN can take in a large collection of image files  
- [ ] Ensure CSA CKAN meets accessibility requirements  
- [ ] Investigate Cloud Storage with CSA CKAN  
- [ ] Implement Nice to Have features found in the roadmap
